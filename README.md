**TodoApi**

---

**Description:**

TodoApi is a simple project developed using .NET 8 and ASP.NET Core Web API. It provides a basic CRUD (Create, Read,
Update, Delete) functionality for managing todo items. The project utilizes Controller Base API for handling HTTP
requests and responses. Entity Framework Core is used for interacting with the SQL Server database. JWTBearer
authentication is implemented for securing the API endpoints.
